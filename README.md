## Copy

Editable copy can be found in the following folders:

  * [about-copy.md](_includes/clive/about-copy.md) - copy for /about
  * [beef.md](_includes/clive/beef.md) - copy for /shop/beef

All of these files are in a format called markdown (files ending with `.md`). This is a shorthand for creating paragraphs, headers, lists, links, images etc (anything you usually see in website copy) without having to write HTML directly. This README is also written in markdown.
